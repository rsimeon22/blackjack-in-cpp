# Blackjack Game in C++

Welcome to the Blackjack game implemented in C++! This is a simple console-based Blackjack game that you can play in your terminal.

## How to Play

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Rules

- The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
- You can choose to "hit" (get another card) or "stand" (keep the current hand).
- The dealer will continue to draw cards until their total is 17 or higher.
- The winner is determined based on the total value of cards without exceeding 21.

## Files
